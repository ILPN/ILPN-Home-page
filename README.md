A skeleton repository for creating modules for the I love Petri nets website.

The repository operates in tandem with the ILPN-Components repository that is a git submodule in this project. The build configuration is a part of this project.

When cloning the project run:

```
git clone --recurse-submodules <git repo link>
```

to initialize the submodules
